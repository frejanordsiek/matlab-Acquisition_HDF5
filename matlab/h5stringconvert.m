function strs = h5stringconvert(h5strings)
%H5STRINGCONVERT converts strings read from HDF5 files to char arrays.
% STRS = H5STRINGCONVERT(H5STRINGS) converts strings read from an HDF5 file
% by the hdf5read command (H5STRINGS) to a string (char array) or cell
% array of strings if there are multiple, which is returned in STRS. This
% function is necessary because the two different ways that strings can be
% stored in HDF5 files yield different return types from hdf5read.
